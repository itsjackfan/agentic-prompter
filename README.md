# THE AGENTIC PROMPTER
My personal agentic prompter built on Ollama to leverage open-source models as workers to put my mind at ease about prompt engineering.

## Quick Start
1. install ollama and run server using `ollama run (model)`
2. run python main.py to get the prompter online
3. prompt the thing and see your steps come out!
