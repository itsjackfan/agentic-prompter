# THE AGENTIC PROMPTER
My personal agentic prompter built on Ollama to leverage open-source models as workers to put my mind at ease about prompt engineering.

## Quick Start
1. install ollama and run server using `ollama run (model)`
2. run `python backend/main.py` to get the prompter online and agentifying things

At the moment, the prompter is running based on the prompt at the very top of `main.py` to allow for longer, more varied contexts. This will obviously get fixed when we have an actual GUI, but it's like this for now.
